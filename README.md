# Chemistry

The periodic table, elements, compounds and cool sciencey things in Minecraft. This is a port / copy of the _Minecraft Education Edition Chemistry_ featiures to a Spigot / Paper plugin.

Requires a resource pack (included in the plugin) for best use.

###Elements creative inventory

| _use:_        | Arrange elements (left to right) in the correct amounts starting in the bottom left slot. Follow the formula for the chemical compound you are trying to create e.g. to make water the formula is _H2O_ so the first slot will have 2 hydrogen and the next slot will have 1 oxygen.
